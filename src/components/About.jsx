      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an Electrical Engineering graduate who switched gears into full-stack Python
        development after training in Bangalore. For the total of 1.5 years with Autobits Labs,
        I’ve been building AI/ML systems, backend services, and automation tools — mostly from
        scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m the kind of developer who can’t leave a problem half-understood; I dive deep,
        figure it out, and deliver something solid. My work’s been recognized for being
        precise, research-oriented, and hands-on.
